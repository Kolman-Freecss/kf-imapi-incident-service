# Incident Management API with Microservices
## Project Overview
This project is a RESTful API built in Java to manage incidents within an organization. 
The API will implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for three main entities: Incident, ResponseTeam, and Notification. 
Each microservice will handle one of these entities and communicate with the others through Kafka message events.

## Project Architecture
The project is designed in a microservices architecture connected via Apache Kafka:

- Incident Service: Manages reported incidents.
- Response Team Service: Manages the response teams assigned to each incident.
- Notification Service: Sends notifications about incident status updates to users.
- Authentication Gateway Service: Manages user authentication and authorization.

## Microservice 1: Incident Service
- Entity: Incident
- Fields: id, title, description, status (enum: REPORTED, IN_PROGRESS, RESOLVED, CLOSED), priority (enum: LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL), reportDate, resolutionDate.
- Requirements:
  - Register and manage incidents through a specific lifecycle (reported, in progress, resolved, closed).
  - Change the incident’s status, triggering real-time updates to assigned teams.
  - Generate Kafka events when an incident status is updated, notifying other microservices.
  - Filter incidents by status and priority.
- API Endpoints:
  - GET /incidents: Retrieve all incidents.
  - GET /incidents/{id}: Retrieve an incident by its ID.
  - POST /incidents: Create a new incident (input: title, description, priority).
  - PUT /incidents/{id}: Update an existing incident (modify status and description).
  - DELETE /incidents/{id}: Delete an incident

## Kafka Event Handling
Each microservice listens to and produces events on Kafka:

1. Incident Service: Produces events whenever an incident is created or its status changes.
2. Response Team Service: Listens for events to automatically assign response teams to critical incidents, producing events when a team is assigned.
3. Notification Service: Listens for events and sends automatic notifications when an incident is created or changes status.

## Technical Requirements
- Data Validation: Each service should include data validation and detailed error handling.
- Swagger/OpenAPI: Automatic documentation generation for each microservice.
- Security: Basic authentication implementation for the microservices' endpoints.
- Logging and Monitoring: Services will generate structured logs to monitor event activity and operation status.

This architecture and structure will allow high scalability and modularity in incident management, distributing responsibilities across three well-defined microservices connected through Kafka. It facilitates a clear separation of business logic and maintains a low coupling between services, making it ideal for production environments where stability and performance are essential.
